# Sea Battle

Sea Battle (also known as Battleships or Battleship. The game of Battleship is thought to have its origins in the French game L'Attaque played during World War I, although parallels have also been drawn to E. I. Horseman's 1890 game Baslinda, and the game is said to have been played by Russian officers before World War I.  The first commercial version of the game was Salvo, published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company. Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's Combat: The Battleship Game, Milton Bradley's Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy and Maurice L. Freedman'sWarfare Naval Combat. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called Wings which pictured planes flying over the Los Angeles Coliseum. All of these early editions of the game consisted of pre-printed pads of paper. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship)

  App Goals:
---


* When playing any of the battleship games you need logic and reason, as well as memory.

* you must remember the shots you’ve taken.

* which square will be next and you must be able to formulate a mental picture of your opponent’s set up and keep that in mind as the game progresses.

* Battleship games introduce school kids to coordinates and grids in a hands-on kind of way

* Battleships is a classic strategy/guessing game of naval combat.

* As a returning regular visitor I would expect all external links to be working and updated.

* All in all, it’s a complete brain workout and a great way to make learning fun.

Critical Thinking Skills:
---
 Battleship games introduce school kids to coordinates and grids in a hands-on kind of way; it helps them understand the relationship between rows and columns, as well as the relationship between an actual object or a sequence of events and how they are represented on a graph.

Battleship requires you to formulate a mental picture of your opponent's set up and to keep that picture in mind, making and remembering adjustments as the game unfolds and new information comes in. Not only that, but you need to be aware of what your opponent is doing also.

 How To Play: 
--- 

   * Firstly choose if you would like to be player one or player two.

   * The chosen player to go first types in start and hits enter.

   * Then guess your row and hit enter.

   * Guess your column and hit enter.

   * Player two has there turn doing the same process.

   * Each turn will show on the 5x5 board an x to see if you have a direct hit or miss.

   * You missed my battleship! will appear to let you know that you missed the target.

   * You guessed that one already, will show if you have typed the same positions on the board during your turn.

   * Each player will have 4 turns to get a direct hit and sink the other opponents ship.

   * Congratulations! you sunk my battleship! will appear if any player is successful in a direct hit.

   * Oops that's not even in the ocean, will also appear if you type in the same location numbers.

   * This game is a draw. will appear if after each player has used up there turn, an option to play again will be offered with the following, play again (y) or (n) 

   * How to win the game! Guess your opponent's ship locations better. [Game play images](https://github.com/Flow-matic/sea-battle/tree/main/images)

User Stories:
---
  
As a user, I want to be able to:

  * See clearly what the game is.

  * Have a easy understanding on how the game is played.

  * Be able to play and enjoy a classic game of battleships.

  * I would like the game to be easy to navigate through.

  * Have a working loop environment without users imput errors.


___

Game Flow Chart:
--- 

Lucidcharts was used to give a visual step by step guide on how the game will play out for each user.

   * [What is a flow chart?](https://lucid.co/)

   * A diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Flowcharts, sometimes spelled as flow charts, use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence.

Testing Code:
---
[Pep8](http://pep8online.com/) sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

Bugs and Errors:
---
Throughout writing my code, I continuously tested the code in [VS Code's](https://code.visualstudio.com/) terminal as well as [Gitpod's terminal](https://www.gitpod.io/)

   * [E501 line too long (107 > 79 characters)]() was the first error when running the code through pep8.

   * For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters as [image shows]().

   * The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses.
